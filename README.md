# py.word-game
My final project for Harvard's CS50 Python, heavily inspired by https://neal.fun/password-game/.

## todo:
- [x] captcha code cleanup
- [ ] make prettier
- [ ] finalize readme
    - [ ] explain program
        - [ ] rules/requirements
    - [ ] explain imported libraries
    - [ ] explain dependencies
    - [ ] what could be done better (input, mainly; clunky clipboard)
    - [ ] add logs
- [ ] submit!

## someday:
- [ ] add a GUI for easier input and prettier overall [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) or [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)


## notes:
`Rule 6: sixNine` and `Rule 13: HH:MM` requirements are quite the hassle later on (that's the point; should be a challenge) But I understand your struggle! (hell, imagine testing the code for yourself!); [this tool that I wrote](https://www.online-python.com/SEMPZn3TDb) (which is basically the `sixNine` requirement) would be useful just so editing attempts in real time would be less of a hassle since you'll be out of the terminal.
Best to add the emojis in the beginning. It's a hassle to use the arrow keys when passing over country flags and other emojis. (I'm not sure if this is a problem with my terminal or the code itself, but it's a problem nonetheless)
