# Logs
> I'm trying to get into the habit of logging throughout creating programs. This may even be considered as [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), but for me it's really helpful for logging wins, voicing out problems, dumping ideas, and mostly 'slow down' time for reflecting on obstacles just so I could tackle them with a clearer mind.
>
> Keep in mind that this is my first ever program written, so my logs are still all over the place/incomplete in logging actual progress! I'm still learning ;).
>
> Also this feels very private! But I'd love to share the journey with whoever lurks in my repos. So enjoy!

> Format:
> - {date and time}: {log} {auxiliary text for my tagging system in Obsidian, where these logs live}
